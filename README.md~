rotor uses a hybrid of NTRU public key encryption and the SHAKE-256 XOF function to encrypt your files. rotor uses a KDF based on yescrypt, using BLAKE-256, output expanded with SHAKE-256, and hashed many times to result in a one time pad that the NTRU private key is XOR'd against, 1:1. actual data is masked with SHAKE-256, using a randomly generated stream key, and encrypted, one block at a time, with NTRU. the final block is padded to the full NTRU block size using SHAKE.
