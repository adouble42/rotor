0.5 (5/14/2016)
 * RNGs: NTRU_RNG_DEFAULT uses CTR_DRBG now, NTRU_RNG_CTR_DRBG replaces NTRU_RNG_IGF2
   This change breaks the API!
 * Denser encoding of private keys
   This change breaks binary compatibility!
 * new API feature: multiple public keys for the same private key
 * new parameter sets: EES443EP1 and EES587EP1
 * new #defines for referencing param sets by strength: NTRU_DEFAULT_PARAMS_xxx_BITS
 * BSD support
 * bugfixes:
  o fixed deterministic encryption on big-endian machines
  o fixed some incorrect error codes when key generation failed
  o fixed generation of polynomial g which deviated from the standard
  o fixed SSE detection on BSD
  o fixed buffer overruns (thanks Jeffrey Quesnelle)
  o fixed a resource leak
  o fixed tests on ARMv6
  o fixed calculation of M_len
 * AVX2 optimizations (thanks Shay Gueron and Fabian Schlieker)
 * minor optimizations

0.4.1 (5/11/2015)
 * Experimental support for OS/2 (thanks Elbert Pol)
 * Fixed build when the CC environment variable is set
 * Fixed a memory leak

0.4 (5/4/2015)
 * massive performance improvements
 * new Makefile targets for distros (thanks Julian Ospald)
 * made the library C++ friendly (thanks Ruben De Smet)
 * new functions: ntru_params_from_key_pair() and ntru_params_from_priv_key()
 * fixed a memory leak
 * fixed parameter values
 * fixed data-dependent branches

0.3 (11/14/2014)
 * option to exclude code that is patented beyond 2017
 * RNG-related API changes for thread safety and closeability of OS handles
 * several bugs fixed
 * sample code for NTRU+AES encryption

0.2 (3/30/2014)
 * supports all EES parameter sets
 * supports deterministic encryption and key generation
 * works on Windows (MinGW)
 * no longer depends on OpenSSL
 * several bugs fixed
 * performance improvements

0.1 (3/19/2012)
