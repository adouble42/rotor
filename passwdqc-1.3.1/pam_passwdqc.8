.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_passwdqc
.Nd Password quality-control PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_passwdqc
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is a simple password strength checking module for
PAM.
In addition to checking regular passwords, it offers support for
passphrases and can provide randomly generated ones.
.Pp
The
.Nm
module provides functionality for only one PAM management group:
password changing.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li password
feature.
.Pp
The
.Fn pam_chauthtok
service function may ask the user for a new password, and verify that
it meets certain minimum standards.
If the chosen password is unsatisfactory, the service function returns
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR .
.Pp
The set of options that may be passed to the module is exactly the
same as the set of options that may be specified in the
.Pa /etc/passwdqc.conf
file.  These options are described in
.Xr passwdqc.conf 5 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pam.conf 5 ,
.Xr passwdqc.conf 5 ,

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
module was written for Openwall GNU/*/Linux by
.An Solar Designer Aq solar at openwall.com .
This manual page was written for the
.Fx
Project by
ThinkSec AS and NAI Labs, the Security Research Division of Network
Associates, Inc. under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035
.Pq Dq CBOSS ,
as part of the DARPA CHATS research program.
It has since been revised, most importantly to refer to
.Xr passwdqc.conf 5
instead of describing the options right on this page.
